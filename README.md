# Sort algorithms_time complexity
Project designed to measure time of sorting arrays, for selected sorting algorithms.

## How to use it
Just run the code and program will do the job for you. 
It will conduct the sorting of arrays in specified by you conditions and using specified by you sorting algorithms. 
At the end it also saves the sorting times to the .txt file in a Miscrosoft Excel friendly manner.

### Which conditions can I specify
- Sizes of data
- Percent of pre-sorted elements
- Number of arrays that will be sorted for each configuration above (more the arrays the better because program calculates the averege time of sorting one array)

These are the basic and most simple to change conditions. It's worth to mention that size of data and percent of pre-sorted elements have each-to-each relation. Nevertheless you can also **implement your own sorting algorithms** and link them to function pointers. Another option is to **change the name of file** so it is easier to recognise for you.

## Wchich sorting algorithms are implememented already
- QuickSort
- MergeSort
- IntroSort
